# endpoint permissions based access

This simple API serves as an illustrative example of how to establish accessibility to a specific endpoint through the implementation of permission-based authorization, enabling user authorization based on the fulfillment of any one of these permissions.

The user sends a request to the endpoint, which is handled by a authorization middleware. The authorization middleware checks if the user has any of the permissions required to access the endpoint. If yes, the user is authorized and the endpoint returns the response. If no, the user is denied and the endpoint returns an error message.
